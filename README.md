# Advent of Code 2023

lets see how many puzzles I can do before work piles up and I won't have any more playtime

## Day one

easy part one, doing this no copilot so had to remind myself some syntax like reading a file lol

the part two was a bit weird, I found on reddit that
`oneight` should result with `18` rather than just leave it
with an eight, Ill now change my `Calibrate` functino
